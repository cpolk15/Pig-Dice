THE THREE CHALLENGES

1. A player losed his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6s in a row. After
   that, it's the nest player's turn. (HINT: Always save the previous dice
   roll in a separate variable)

2. Add an input field to the HTML where players can set the winning score
   so that they can change the predefined winning score of 100. 
   (HINT: You can read that value with the .value property in JScript.
   this is a good opportunity to google this)

3. Add another dice to the game, so that there are two dice now. 
   The player loses their current score when one of them rolls a 1.
   (HINT: You will need CSS to position the second dice, so take a 
   look at the CSS code from the first die.)
